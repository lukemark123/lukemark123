# Hi there, I'm Luke 👋

I'm a vocational student in **Information and Communications Technology** at [Vantaa Vocational College Varia](https://varia.vantaa.fi/en) in Finland 🇫🇮.

Passionate about coding, building things from scratch, and diving into how hardware works.

## 🚀 About Me
- Studying **Tieto- ja viestintätekniikka** (ICT) — focusing on practical skills in software, networks, and emerging tech like wellbeing technology.
- Main languages: **Python** 🐍 and **C++** ⚡
- Whenever I'm bored, I fire up a new project — mixing code, creativity, and sometimes hardware tinkering.
- Currently learning more about electronics, embedded systems, and low-level stuff.
